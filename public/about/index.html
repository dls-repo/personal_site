Hi! I&rsquo;m Dan. I&rsquo;m a 21 year old student at Cal Poly Pomona on track to get a degree in Electronic Systems &amp; Engineering Technology. Like many kids in my field, I grew up playing video games, which was my gateway into the world of computing. The PlayStation 2 was one of my first consoles, and I remember playing the same 6 or so games religiously, which meant I was always discovering nuances and tricks about the game engine. I don&rsquo;t game as much as I used to, but the systematic mindset I developed playing games has found its way into many other parts of my life, particularly my career.">

<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Dan. I&rsquo;m a 21 year old student at Cal Poly Pomona on track to get a degree in Electronic Systems &amp; Engineering Technology. Like many kids in my field, I grew up playing video games, which was my gateway into the world of computing. The PlayStation 2 was one of my first consoles, and I remember playing the same 6 or so games religiously, which meant I was always discovering nuances and tricks about the game engine. I don&rsquo;t game as much as I used to, but the systematic mindset I developed playing games has found its way into many other parts of my life, particularly my career.</p>
<p>I am very much a proponent of learning every part of a process, which is why I have made it my mission to take on more hardware projects. I am an autodidact in most respects, which has tremendously increased my knowledge on building computers, running containerized services for clients, and doing things reliably and efficiently. As much as I love software, going to school for electronics has pushed me out of my comfort zone and has bridged many of the gaps in my understanding.</p>
<p>Being well-rounded is important to me, so although technology is a very significant part of my life, it is not everything. Reaching adulthood has inspired me to reflect on my soft-skills and seek enjoyment from more &ldquo;sustainable&rdquo; sources; I have found enrichment in learning how to cook family recipes, designing hydroponic gardens, and understanding how to leverage my finances to create a diverse and well-padded portfolio. My obsession with automation has infiltrated many of my interests, creating niche combinations and an endless source of mental stimulation.</p>
